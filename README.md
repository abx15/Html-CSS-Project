# 💻 HTML & CSS Front-End Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of my front-end development projects created using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. Each project is placed inside its own folder, with separate structure and styling. These projects are built for practice, learning, and showcasing basic to intermediate web design skills.
